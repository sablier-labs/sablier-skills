# Sablier Product Selection

## Overview

Sablier offers three products for onchain token distribution. This skill helps choose the right one for a given use case, then routes to the appropriate creation skill.

| Product      | Purpose                                                    | Chains       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Lockup**   | Vesting with a fixed schedule — tokens locked upfront      | EVM + Solana |
| **Flow**     | Open-ended streaming — adjustable rate, no upfront deposit | EVM only     |
| **Airdrops** | Merkle-tree distribution to many recipients                | EVM + Solana |

**Creation skills:**

- Lockup streams (LL, LD, LT) → `sablier-create-vesting`
- Flow streams → `sablier-create-payment`
- Merkle Airdrops → `sablier-create-airdrop` (coming soon)

Q1: What kind of token distribution do you need?
├─ Vesting (fixed schedule, tokens locked upfront) ──► Q2
├─ Airdrop (distribute to many recipients) ──► see `sablier-create-airdrop` skill (coming soon)
└─ Payroll / ongoing payments ──► Q6

Q2: Do you need a custom unlock curve (exponential, logarithmic, etc.)?
├─ Yes ──► Q3

## Product Comparison

### Lockup — Vesting Streams

Tokens are locked upfront and released over time according to a fixed schedule. Three stream shapes:

- **Linear (LL)** — Constant unlock rate with optional start unlock and cliff. EVM + Solana.
- **Dynamic (LD)** — Custom curve via configurable segments with exponents. EVM only.
- **Tranched (LT)** — Discrete unlocks at specific timestamps. EVM + Solana.

All Lockup positions are represented as NFTs (ERC-721 on EVM, MPL Core on Solana).

### Flow — Payment Streams

Open-ended streaming with no fixed end date. Key features:

- Adjustable rate in real time without recreating the stream
- Pause and resume support
- No upfront deposit required — sender tops up as needed
- EVM only

### Airdrops — Merkle Distribution

Merkle-tree based distribution for large recipient sets:

- Gas-optimized claiming — recipients pay their own claim gas
- Optional vesting — tokens can stream after claim
- Clawback support for unclaimed allocations
- EVM + Solana
