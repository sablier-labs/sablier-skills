# Merkle Tree Generation

This reference covers the full process: collecting recipient data, generating the Merkle tree locally, pinning the campaign JSON to IPFS through Pinata v3, and extracting the values needed for campaign deployment. The agent handles every step — the only user-provided inputs are the recipient CSV and a single Pinata JWT.

## 1) Collect Recipient Data

The agent must obtain a CSV with `address` and `amount` columns.

**Primary — file path:** Ask the user for a path to a CSV on their filesystem. Read the file and verify it exists and is non-empty before proceeding.

**Fallback — inline data:** For small recipient lists (roughly 20 or fewer), the user may paste CSV rows directly in chat. Write the data to a temporary file:

```bash
cat > /tmp/recipients.csv << 'EOF'
address,amount
0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111,1000
0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222,500
EOF
```

Set `CSV_FILE` to the file path and proceed.

### CSV Format

- Header row must be exactly `address,amount`
- Amounts in **human-readable units** (not base units) — the local generator handles decimal conversion
- Addresses must be valid EVM addresses; the generator normalizes them to checksummed form
- No duplicate addresses allowed
- All amounts must be positive and non-zero
- Decimal places in amounts must not exceed the token's `decimals` value
- The CSV must contain at least **2 recipients**

Example:

```csv
address,amount
0x9ad7CAD4F10D0c3f875b8a2fd292590490c9f491,100.0
0xf976aF93B0A5A9F55A7f285a3B5355B8575Eb5bc,200.0
0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC,50.5
```

### Pre-submission Validation

Before running the generator, verify:

1. The file exists and is readable.
2. The header row is exactly `address,amount`.
3. There are at least two data rows after the header.
4. All addresses match the `0x[0-9a-fA-F]{40}` pattern.
5. All amounts are numeric and positive.

If any check fails, show the user the specific error and ask them to fix the CSV.

## 2) Resolve Token Decimals

Query the token's `decimals` from the chain — this is required by the API:

```bash
DECIMALS=$(cast call "$TOKEN" "decimals()(uint8)" --rpc-url "$RPC_URL")
```

## 3) Install the Local Generator

The airdrop skill ships with a local Node helper that reproduces the Merkle API create path without cloning or running the Rust server.

Install the package once:

```bash
npm install --prefix "skills/sablier-create-airdrop/scripts"
```

This requires Node.js. No Rust toolchain or local `merkle-api` process is needed.

### Obtain a Pinata JWT

The local generator uploads the campaign JSON artifact to IPFS through Pinata v3's Files API on the public network.

Ask the user to open the Pinata API keys page at [https://app.pinata.cloud/developers/api-keys](https://app.pinata.cloud/developers/api-keys), create an API key, and copy the JWT as:

- `PINATA_JWT`

Inform the user they only need `Write` permission for the `Files` resource.

## 4) Run the Local Generator and Parse Its Output

```bash
PINATA_JWT="$PINATA_JWT" \
  node "skills/sablier-create-airdrop/scripts/generate-merkle-campaign.mjs" \
    --csv-file "$CSV_FILE" \
    --decimals "$DECIMALS" \
    --result-file /tmp/sablier-merkle-result.json
```

**On success:**

The CLI writes JSON to `/tmp/sablier-merkle-result.json`:

```json
{
  "root": "0x1234abcd...",
  "cid": "bafy...",
  "total": "10000000000",
  "recipients": "50",
  "artifactPath": "/var/folders/.../recipients.campaign.json"
}
```

Parse the result file:

```bash
MERKLE_ROOT=$(jq -r '.root' /tmp/sablier-merkle-result.json)
IPFS_CID=$(jq -r '.cid' /tmp/sablier-merkle-result.json)
AGGREGATE_AMOUNT=$(jq -r '.total' /tmp/sablier-merkle-result.json)
RECIPIENT_COUNT=$(jq -r '.recipients' /tmp/sablier-merkle-result.json)
ARTIFACT_PATH=$(jq -r '.artifactPath' /tmp/sablier-merkle-result.json)
```

- `root` — the Merkle root (`bytes32`) for the campaign's `merkleRoot` parameter.
- `cid` — the IPFS CID for the campaign's `ipfsCID` parameter.
- `total` — the aggregate amount already converted to the token's base units. Use directly as `aggregateAmount`.
- `recipients` — the recipient count. Use directly as `recipientCount`.
- `artifactPath` — the JSON file that was pinned to IPFS. Keep it for debugging or audits.

**On validation error:**

The CLI exits non-zero and prints JSON to stderr:

```json
{
  "status": "Invalid csv file.",
  "errors": [
    "Row 3: Invalid Ethereum address",
    "Row 5: Amounts should be positive, in normal notation, with an optional decimal point and a maximum number of decimals as provided by the query parameter."
  ]
}
```

Show the errors to the user and ask them to fix the CSV before retrying.

**On Pinata upload error:**

Diagnose before stopping:

- Is `PINATA_JWT` set?
- Is the JWT valid in Pinata?
- Does the key have `Write` permission for the `Files` resource?
- Is the CSV valid per the [format above](#csv-format)?

Do not proceed with campaign deployment until the generator returns all four deployment values successfully.

## Leaf Encoding (Reference)

Each leaf encodes three values — `(index, recipient, amount)` — and is **double-hashed** with keccak256 for second preimage resistance. The local generator uses OpenZeppelin's standard Merkle tree implementation with the same leaf schema as the Merkle API create path.
